    "text": "Project 1\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis project aimed to predict the outcomes of NBA games during the 2023-2024 season using past game statistics. The objective was to develop a statistical model capable of estimating game results based on historical performance, team matchups, and engineered features. The primary challenge was structuring the data for predictive modeling, which involved extensive feature engineering and selection techniques.\n\n\nProcess\n\nData Preprocessing:\n\nCleaned the dataset of 1,230 games, ensuring statistical integrity.\nReshaped data so each entry contained all relevant statistics for a single game rather than separate team-specific entries.\nStandardized numerical features to maintain consistency across different scales.\n\nFeature Engineering:\n\nCreated new variables such as block percentage and assist percentage to capture team performance more effectively.\nIntroduced a team instability metric, measuring performance variance across games to assess consistency.\nComputed weighted mean past statistics, giving greater importance to recent games, home/away status, and previous matchups.\nUsed relative statistical measures (e.g., raw difference, squared difference) to better contextualize team performance.\n\nFeature Selection:\n\nApplied L1-regularized Logistic Regression to identify the most informative variables.\nFurther refined the feature set through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and forward selection, ultimately reducing the model to two key variables:\nA principal component combining point difference and field goal percentage.\nThe raw count of successful three-point shots.\n\nModeling and Evaluation:\n\nExperimented with various predictive models, including:\n\nLogistic Regression\nLinear and Radial Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nLinear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA, QDA)\nRandom Forest\n\nTuned hyperparameters via grid search and cross-validation to optimize accuracy.\nFound Linear SVM to be the best-performing model, achieving a validation accuracy of 68.7%.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nSuccessfully built a predictive model with nearly 70% accuracy using only two key features.\nIdentified home/away performance weighting as a significant factor in prediction accuracy.\nDetermined that Random Forest performed poorly due to excessive feature reduction, which limited its effectiveness.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Future Improvements\n\nThe current model relies on team-level statistics; incorporating individual player data and roster changes could improve predictions.\nPlaystyle categorization (e.g., defensive vs. offensive strategies) may enhance feature selection.\nExploring alternative matchup weighting schemes (e.g., team similarity metrics) could refine performance estimates.\nFurther expanding the dataset beyond a single season might enhance model generalizability.\n\n\n\nDocument\n2023-2024 NBA Results Prediction"
